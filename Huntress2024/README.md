# Huntress CTF 2024

Welcome to my write-ups for the **Huntress CTF 2024**! This Capture The Flag competition was an exciting opportunity to tackle challenges across various cybersecurity domains, including cryptography, steganography, reverse engineering, web exploitation, and more. These write-ups showcase my approach, techniques, and lessons learned while solving the challenges.

###### I wish I completed more but I was in the middle of finals for BS in Cybersecurity. Was still a fun experience and cannot wait till the next one.
